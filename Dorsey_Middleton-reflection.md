## GPS 2.1 Reflection

Answer these questions in your reflection:

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Trying to keep everything straight about which branch I was working on. If I stopped working on something, then went back to master, I'd forget to change back to the branch and have to push master-to-master, rather than branch-to-master.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * New Repo process, having the collaborator merge & confirm.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * Due to technical difficulties, my audio wasn't working correctly so I felt like I was struggling to work smoothly thru the problems. When I was driving, I couldn't get all the input the navigator was providing so I moved forward and made changes as I thought necessary.

* What still confuses you about Git?
  * I cleaned up all my branches in Git but I didn't delete those branches in my local repository. Now I have lots of branches on my computer. Should I be not only deleting the files in Git but also go back and delete it on my local computer also?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * It was frustrating for me because of the audio problems. I came away with a key learning to do a "RESTART" before my HangOut or GPS so that I can be sure I eliminate any potential problems.
