- **What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I wouldn't particularly say I was struggling with concepts, but I didn't have experience seeing the Git workflow in action amongst multiple people. I was also terrified of merge conflicts. I also wasn't clear on how GitHub works in practice, and I'm much better equipped to work with it now.

- **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I learned a lot about merge conflicts and team management of a repo. I'd only ever worked with a forked repo before, so it was cool to see how things differ on one that's actually shared between collaborators instead of split and merged about.  I also understand how to handle a basic merge conflict. While I'm still apprehensive about seeing one where new, conflicting functions have been written, they're not the boogeyman they once were.


- **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Most of the questions I asked my pair (beyond those specified in the assignment guidelines), were things to understand how she thought about things and how they differed from my understand. We also had technical difficulties with the connection, so we didn't have much conversation that wasn't explicitly geared towards the specific tasks at hand. The questions we asked Gary were typically bigger, structural questions. "What do you think about deleting a branch at this point based on what we've both said so far?" and "Does that sound consistent with best practices, or just what we think so far?"


- **What still confuses you about Git?**

We haven't touched on this in curriculum yet, but revert commits or otherwise using the history to move backwards. That's what's currently missing in the flow. Effective branching should make this less necessary, but there will still be times within a particular branch where something will go awry between commits. The ability to move backwards feels like leveling up.

- **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

On the whole, very good. I have a lot of work to put in around be navigable. I'm generally pretty eager and dive headlong into problems, especially if I know what to do. I asked lots of questions and Maggie moved and raised questions and made sure she was clear on what we were doing every step of the way on both ends. It's difficult in an assessment environment to remember that getting to done as quickly as possible isn't the actual goal so much as getting to a shared understanding.
